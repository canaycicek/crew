	"about-description": "I'm Can Aycicek (Crew). I got interested in music in 2018 and began using FL Studio DAW in 2019. By 2020, I had taken my projects to a professional level and currently create many genres under the Hip-Hop umbrella, including Trap, R&B, Drill, DeepHouse, and more, in a professional manner. I share the songs and beats I create for you on my YT channel under the headings free beat and free for profit beat. Also, I create various packages such as Sample Pack and Drum Pack to share those packages with you.. If you want to communicate with me, you can reach me through my social media accounts or e-mail listed in the contact section. Enjoy listening, and stay in touch with music....",
